<h1>Crypto Web Scraper App</h1>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>I created this web scraper app to help practice and develop my back-end skills. It was desgined to scrape cryptocurrency data from the CoinMarketCap website and display is on a browser.</p>

<h3>Development</h3>
<p>I used NodeJS and the Express framework on the back-end. I used the axios npm tool in order to retrieve the data and then used the cheerio to parse the data. The data was sent to the browser and displayed on table. </p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The main challenges involved retrieving the required data from the html data set. Using the chrome dev tools to find the specific html selector helped a lot.</p>
